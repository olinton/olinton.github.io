				Nicola was born in Poggiardo (Apulia, Italy) and studied Physics at the University of Pisa, obtaining his BSc and Masters degrees with a curriculum in condensed matter. For his PhD he changed to a different institution, Scuola Normale Superiore (Pisa), and a different subject, computational chemistry, working with Prof. Vincenzo Barone on an integrated quantum - classical approach to the prediction of spectra of flexible molecules in condensed phase. He then moved to Cambridge in 2015 for a postdoc with Prof. Hunter focused on the modelling of non-covalent interactions in solution. In his free time, he is sadly often on the computer doing some geeky stuff, but sometimes he enjoys cycling and taking photos.			</td>

He studied Chemistry and a Masters in Nanotechnology at the University of Valencia, working on the development of a method to measure the conductivity of organic molecules using Au-NPs arrays. In the Hunter group, he is working on supramolecular oligomers.

				Geneva grew up in Waxahachie, Texas and obtained her B. Sci. in Chemistry from Texas Tech University. During her PhD at the University of Cambridge, she studied novel syntheses and structures in expanded porphyrin chemistry under the supervision of Dr Nick Bampos. Thereafter she researched porous materials in the group of Prof Louisa Hope-Weeks at Texas Tech before returning to Cambridge in 2013 as a post-doctoral researcher with Prof Jeremy Sanders, FRS, in the area of dynamic combinatorial chemistry. She joined the Hunter Group in 2014. She enjoys crochet, cooking (and eating!), relaxing with friends, and placid outdoor environments.			</td>

				Mark was born in London and grew up in Hertfordshire. Having read Chemistry at Imperial College London, he remained there for an MRes in Biomolecular Sciences and a Ph.D. on "Novel QM/MM Investigations of Enzyme Catalysis" with Ian R. Gould and David Klug. He then left the UK for a postdoc at the San Diego Super Computing Center where he worked on improving the parallel efficiency of the AMBER molecular dynamics code within the context of a DOE biofuels project. He also developed an affinity for surfing here. On his return to the UK, he joined the Glen group at Cambridge and worked on modelling Cytochrome P450 systems with the aim to aid xenobiotic metabolism prediction. He now has a hybrid role within the Hunter group, developing software and pursuing research projects. Other interests include diving, cycling and random geekery.			</td>
