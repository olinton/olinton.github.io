				Dr John Smith was born in Madrid, where she studied her BSc in Chemistry specialising in Organic Chemistry at the University Complutense. She obtained her PhD from The City University (London) under the supervision of Professor Stephen Matlin, developing HPLC methodologies to analyse male and female contraceptives and to isolate the contraceptive active ingredients for in-vivo animal studies. She has worked in management positions in the analytical sections of the Research and Development departments in the pharmaceutical industry in the UK. She moved in 2002 to the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge joining the group of Professor Jeremy Sanders where she is still working. She is the HPLC and LCMS expert for the Hunter group. When not in the lab, Ana likes walking, science, natural history, listening to classical music and visiting museums.
